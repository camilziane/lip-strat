**Observation** — `n_matches × 11` per match:
`implied_p1, implied_pN, implied_p2, rep1, repN, rep2, margin, log_spread, value1, valueN, value2`

**Action** — `n_matches × 3` binary mask; total combos = product of per-match selections, capped at `k_max`

**Reward** — `(total_earnings − n_combos × 1€) / n_combos`
Sparse: only non-zero when at least one combo wins a prize (rang1–rang4)

**Policy** — linear (`hidden_dim=0`) or one-hidden-layer MLP (`hidden_dim>0`)
Algorithm: REINFORCE + entropy regularisation + Adam + EMA baseline

**Score** — `avg(val, test)_net/round_capped_at_100 + 50 × avg(val, test)_hit_rate`
Higher is better. Cap prevents a single jackpot from dominating.

**Prizes (rang1–rang4)** — rang1 = all 8 correct, rang2 = 7 correct, etc.
Prize amounts vary by round (pari-mutuel pool). Typical rang1 ≈ €100–500k.

## What Was Tried

## Key Observations

- **All strategies lose money most of the time** — prizes are sparse (rang1 requires 8/8 correct)
- **Val/test split is very noisy** — 17 rounds each means 1 winning round ≈ 6% hit rate; results have high variance

---

## What to Try Next

**Analysis of baseline results (5 trials):**
The key finding is that entropy_low (entropy=0.01) achieved val_hit=6% while all others had 0%. Low entropy forces the policy to commit to specific outcomes rather than hedging, which is necessary to win prizes (you need all 8 correct). The gap between val (-12.11) and test (-18.00) is partially noise (17 rounds each) but the direction is real.

**Next steps (priority order):**
1. entropy_low + k=32/50: if low entropy helps win rounds, more combos gives more chances to hit
2. entropy_zero (0.0): fully deterministic convergence to the most likely outcomes per match
3. Multi-seed entropy_low (5 seeds): reduce init variance and find better trained model
4. Dense reward + low entropy: correctness_coef=0.1 + entropy=0.01 for better learning signal
5. Longer training (12k-20k episodes) with entropy=0.01
6. MLP + low entropy: h=32/64 with entropy=0.01 might capture nonlinear interactions
7. Entropy annealing: start broad (0.3), anneal to 0.01 for coverage then focus
